# Hi There 👋🏾,

## A few things about me

- I live on Bitbucket now 😅
- Exploring software engineering
- Learning to build stellar frontend experiences
- Mastering data structures and algorithms
- Interested in low-level programming languages
- Looking to contribute to open source

There's a lot to learn in so little time and I honestly can't wait🔥. If you're as excited as I am, you could drop me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vick_OnRails) and let's be internet friends 😊
