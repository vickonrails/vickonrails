## Hi 👋🏾,


I have 5 years experience as a software engineer, building tools and products that help people achieve more. I have previously worked for companies like [Staffbase](https://staffbase.com/), [Contentful](https://contentful.com), etc. Right now I am available for <b>senior frontend-focused positions</b> to build more tools to help people achieve more. I bring a ton of experience building design systems, also for accessibility and performance. Feel free to reach out!
